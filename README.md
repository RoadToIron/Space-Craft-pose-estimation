# Space-Craft-pose-estimation
This project is dedicated to advancing autonomous space operations through precise spacecraft pose estimation, a critical capability for tasks like rendezvous, docking, and debris removal. Our work specifically utilizes the challenging Speed+ dataset, aiming to achieve a top 20 ranking in the prestigious Kelvin Pose Estimation Challenge. A primary hurdle in this domain stems from the incredibly harsh space environment, which introduces significant variability and degradation to visual data. Images acquired in space are frequently plagued by extreme illumination changes, direct sun glint, cosmic radiation effects, and sensor noise, severely impacting their quality and reliability.

Furthermore, target spacecraft often appear with unpredictable scales, arbitrary rotations, and partial occlusions, making robust feature extraction immensely difficult. Consequently, rigorous image preprocessing is an absolutely essential first step to mitigate these adverse conditions and prepare the data for analysis. Our methodology incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques such as adaptive contrast enhancement, sophisticated denoising filters, and careful image normalization to standardize and improve the visual input. Beyond image quality, the operational context demands exceptional efficiency and real-time performance from our pose estimation system.

For critical maneuvers in space, split-second decisions are required, meaning the algorithms must process visual data and output pose estimates with minimal latency. This necessity for real-time operation is compounded by the inherent computational constraints of onboard spacecraft processors. Therefore, our chosen computer vision and machine learning models are meticulously optimized for both speed and accuracy. The system is designed to be highly robust, capable of performing reliably despite the wide range of challenging scenarios encountered in orbit. We will rigorously evaluate our solution against the Kelvin Challenge's stringent metrics, demonstrating its ability to accurately determine a spacecraft's 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) pose under diverse conditions. Achieving a top 20 score will validate the system's readiness for practical application, pushing the boundaries of autonomous navigation in demanding extraterrestrial environments. This project represents a significant step towards more independent and capable spacecraft.
